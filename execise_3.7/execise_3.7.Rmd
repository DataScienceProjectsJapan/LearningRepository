```

## Easy
### Exercise 1

In this execise we are going to use new dataset called diamonds.
Run the code below to get to know diamonds.
```{r 1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
?diamonds
```

### Exercise 2  

```{r quiz}
question("According to the text, which kind of graph compute a robust summary of the distribution and then display a specially formatted box?",
  answer("boxplots", correct = TRUE),
  answer("bar graph"),
  answer("scatter plot"),
  answer("spider chart")
)
```

## Intermediate
### Exercise 3



Run the code below. That code have "stat_count" and you can see the graph. Change variable of x-axis to "color".
```{r 3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  stat_count(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```
### Exercise 4
Run the code below at first.
```{r 4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = stat(prop), group = 1))
```

```{r quiz2}
question("what does prep in the code mean? ",
  answer("variable prep"),
  answer("count of each variable"),
  answer("what percentage does each varlable occupy.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("No answer here")
)
```



## Advance
### Exercise 5

Create the graphs below.(Top and bottom of each line and each point means max value, minimum value and median respectively.)
