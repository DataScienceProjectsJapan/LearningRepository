## 3.5.1 Exercises

### 1. What happens if you facet on a continuous variable? 


Run the this code:

```{r facet, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
    facet_wrap(~ hwy, nrow = 2)
```

This is the graph that is splitted into facets on continuous value(hwy).
I could facet on continuous value, but that does not seems to be good because it is splittted into too many parts. The larger the range of continuous value is, the more confusing the graph is.

### 2. What do the empty cells in plot with facet_grid(drv ~ cyl) mean? How do they relate to this plot?

Run the this code:

```{r socond_question, exercise=TRUE}

ggplot(data = mpg) +
 geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y= hwy)) + 
 facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)

```

```{r socond_question_second_chunk, exercise=TRUE}

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))


```
On the first graph, I added additional variables( drv, cyl ) to the graph by using facet_grid.
On the other hand, 
Empty sells in the first graph means that there is no data that have the certain combinations of  drv and  cyl
Second graph does not have such empty cells because it just is plotted with cyl as Y-axis and drv as X-axis.


### 3. What plots does the following code make? What does “.” do? 

```{r third_question, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ .)

```

```{r third_question_second_chunk, exercise=TRUE}

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ cyl)

```

If we remove “.” from the code above, what happen? Let’s try.

```{r third_question_third_chunk, exercise=TRUE}

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid( ~ cyl)

```
Same plot is made. Therefore, “.” simply states only one variable is added in this code. 

### 4. Take the first faceted plot in this section; What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic? What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset? 


```{r fourth_question, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)

```
The advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic is that we can categorize data and identify the correlation without confusion. If we have large dataset, it is difficult for us to distinguish different colours and identify the correlation. However, if added variables is continuous value, using faceting is not good option because that might split plot into too many cells.

### 5. Read ?facet_wrap. What does nrow do? What does ncol do? What other options control the layout of the individual panels? Why doesn’t facet_grid() have nrow and ncol arguments?

ncol and nrow designate the number of row and columns that plot have. 
For instance, 

```{r fifth_question}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
   geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
   facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 3)

```

This graph have 3 rows and

```{r fifth_question_second}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
     geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
     facet_wrap(~ class, ncol = 1)

```

This graph have only 1 column.

There are other arguments that control the layout of the individual panels like strip.position

facet_grid() does not have nrow and ncol arguments because number of row and and col is defined by the number of added variables.

### 6. When using facet_grid() you should usually put the variable with more unique levels in the columns. Why?

I am not sure but I assume that makes us to recognize features that plot have more easily.
